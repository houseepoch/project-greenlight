# Prime Directive

## THE RULE

**Read folder names top-to-bottom. Execute in sequence.**

```
_CONTEXT/00_●_READ_FIRST_ALWAYS/    ← You are here
_CONTEXT/01_🎯_PRIMARY_GOAL/        ← Load next
_CONTEXT/02_⚓_PROJECT_CONTEXT/     ← Then this
_CONTEXT/03_◆_CURRENT_STATE/        ← Then this
```

## HOW THIS WORKS

1. Numbers = Order (00 before 01 before 02)
2. Glyphs = Meaning (● critical, 🎯 goal, ⚓ anchor, ◆ active)
3. Names = Instructions (READ_FIRST, PRIMARY_GOAL, etc.)

## THE FILESYSTEM IS YOUR PROGRAM

Don't look for instructions in files first.
Read the folder/file names. They tell you what to do.

## CONSENT IS MANDATORY

⏸ appears throughout this project.
It means: **STOP. Get user approval before proceeding.**
